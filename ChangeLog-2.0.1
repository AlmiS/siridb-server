  * Only try to load a database from a directory containing at least the
    files 'database.conf' and 'database.dat'. This prevents trying to load
    from directories like lost+found etc. (issue #1)
  * Increased UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE from four to eigth and prevent SiriDB
    from loading more than four databases. (issue #2)
  * Removed unneeded msgpack.h dependency. (issue #3)
  * To prevent compile warning on 32-bit linux we now cast int64_t and uint64_t
    to "lld" (long long) and "llu" (unsigned long long). (issue #4)
