  * Only try to load a database from a directory containing at least the
    files 'database.conf' and 'database.dat'. This prevents trying to load
    from directories like lost+found etc. (issue #1)
  * Increased UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE from four to eight and prevent SiriDB
    from loading more than four databases. (issue #2)
  * Removed unneeded msgpack.h dependency. (issue #3)
  * To prevent compile warning on 32-bit linux we now cast int64_t and uint64_t
    to "lld" (long long) and "llu" (unsigned long long). (issue #4)  
  * Dependencies in cleri (with siridb) are removed. (issue #5)
  * Respond with BPROTO_AUTH_ERR_UNKNOWN_UUID in case the authentication 
    request contains the servers own UUID. (issue #6)
  * Added CPROTO_REQ_FILE_GROUPS to type translate function. (issue #7)
  * Added support for an optimize interval of zero which disables the 
    optimize task. (enhancement issue #8)
  * Implemented configuration file changes (see issue #9)
  * Fixed resolving an ip address for a given hostname or fqdn. (for more
    information see issue #10)
  * Fixed writing uninitialized data while enabling or disabling backup mode
    by setting the correct package size. (issue #11)
