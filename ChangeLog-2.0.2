  * Check user for permissions when inserting data. Only authentication was 
    checked, not if the user had 'insert' privileges. (issue #16)
    
  * Minor performance updates by creating macros for frequently used
    functions. (see issue #17 for more info)
    
  * Store reference counter for a series object in an uint32_t. This solves 
    a bug on big endian systems. (issue #18)
    
  * Remove server_id and idx_tp from series object and set those as flags.
    This removed the unneeded pads and saves 8 bytes for each series object.
    
  * Honor ip_support setting when sending a dns request. (issue #19)
