Before building a new version we need to freeze the master branche, create a 
changelog and set the correct version in version.h

0. Make sure the debug version is tested and changelogs etc. are correct.

1. Build Release version
make clean 		(if not done already...)
make			(check for error, warnings etc)

2. Run tests with release version
change BUILDTYPE in test script to 'Release' and run the tests

3. Create a new branch (replace x.y.z with the new version)
git checkout -b x.y.z

4. Push to remote origin (again, replace x.y.z with your version)
git push origin x.y.z

5. Check out to master
git check master

6. Build debian packages
./build_deb.py

7. Test package
sudo dpkg -i build/siridb-server...deb

7. Upload debian package, update links etc.
